## Usage 

This Note Taker was designed using Express servers in Node. It retrieves information from the client user and inputs their data into the server, where it is stored and requested by the user. This app is useful to users who are task-driven and could use an organizational tool to stay on track. It was also designed to meet the criteria for GT Full-stack Flex program homework requirements.

## Credits

This was a solo project completed as homework for the Georgia Tech, FullStack Flex program. However, I recieved insight on how to generate an id dynamically so that it can be deleted by my tutor, Kevin Ferguson. My TA ,Peter Colella, acted as a sounding board for thinking through my ideas for setting up the code.
